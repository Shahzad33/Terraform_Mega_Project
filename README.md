# Terraform GCP Infrastructure

This repository contains Terraform configurations to set up and manage infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v1.0.0 or higher
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- A GCP account with necessary permissions to create resources

## Setup

### 1. Authenticate with GCP

Authenticate your local machine with GCP using the Google Cloud SDK:

```sh
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-gcp-infrastructure.git
cd terraform-gcp-infrastructure
3. Configure GCP Project
Set your GCP project and other necessary variables in the variables.tf file or create a terraform.tfvars file to specify your variables:

# terraform.tfvars
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
region     = "us-central1"
4. Initialize Terraform
Initialize the Terraform working directory. This step downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend:

terraform init
5. Plan and Apply Changes
Run terraform plan to see the changes that will be made, and terraform apply to apply the changes:

terraform plan
terraform apply
6. Verify the Infrastructure
After applying the changes, you can verify your infrastructure in the GCP Console.

Usage
You can customize the Terraform configurations to suit your needs. The following resources are included in this configuration:

A VPC network
Subnetworks
VM instances
Cloud Storage buckets
Modify the main.tf file to add or remove resources as needed.

Clean Up
To destroy the infrastructure created by Terraform, run:

terraform destroy
This will remove all resources defined in your Terraform configuration.
